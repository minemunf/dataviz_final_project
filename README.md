The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find my project that examines the 3 most fuel-efficient cars, both electric and gas-powered, for each year from 2012 to 2017. It also shows the most efficient car for each year from 2000-2017, and plots the efficiencies over time.

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the classifications and statistics of Soccer/Football players represented in FIFA 2018's Roster. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

## Project 03

In this project, I explored and visualized the Florida Climate Center's Tampa International Airport Dataset for 2022, including how heavy the rain was throughout each month, and the maximum temperatures. I also explored and visualized a word count for Rate My Professor comments in various math classes.

### Moving Forward

I have learned much in this course. While i was able to do basic analysis and data wrangling coming out of my Data Wrangling course, what I produced always made it clear that I am an outsider to the field of data analysis. I now feel more integrated and knowledgeable in my abilities to analyze, interpret, and communicate data in a way that a clear story can be told to those who wish to understand. I plan to continue using this knowledge in the future in both the engineering and corporate worlds as i start various businesses and work for various companies. I would like to continue exploring various datasets, such as those about world occurrences, now that i know how to explore and visualize them to get a coherent message out of them.
