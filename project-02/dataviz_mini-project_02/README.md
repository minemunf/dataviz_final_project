## Mini-Project 2

This project aims to bring insight into the classifications and statistics of Soccer/Football players represented in FIFA 2018's Roster. This project has been modified to include visualizations in the report as requested.

- Firstly, I looked at the ages and overall performance scores of the top 100 performant players in the game(top 100 performance scores) and plotted the data. this revealed that performance scores peak at an age of around 30-32.

- Next, i looked at the top 20 performant players and focused on where they came from. this reveals that most of the top 20 comes from either south america or western-to-mid europe.

- Lastly, i looked at the assigned Free-Kick accuracy scores and "finishing" scores. note: "finishing" in soccer/football is the ability to score goals. I plotted the top 100 performant players for finishing scores (top 100 finishing-score players) and plotted the free-kick accuracy score as a function of the finishing score, and found that there is a slight increase in free-kick accuracy as the finishing score increases, which makes sense, as scoring goals often involves kicking the ball at the net.
