## Mini-Project 1

This project examines the 3 most fuel-efficient cars, both electric and gas-powered, for each year from 2012 to 2017. it also shows the most efficient car for each year from 2000-2017, and plots the efficiencies over time.

This project has found that, over the last 5 years, the combined mpg of the top 3 cars, both electric and gas-powered, has either remained constant or increased year-on-year.

It also shows that while very economical cars (over 60 mpg combined) were rather spotty in their availability in the 2000's, they were available every year beyond 2010.

Data comes from the EPA, who measured this data at their National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory from 1984 to 2017.
